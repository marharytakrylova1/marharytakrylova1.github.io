1.	Experience Type: Paid Employment-Medical Clinical
Experience Name: Urgent Care Medical Assistant 
Contact Name, Title: Shannon Courage; Clinic Manager 
Contact Email: shannon.courage@carbonhealth.com
Organization Name: Carbon Health
City, State, Country: Boston, MA, USA
Contact Phone:
Dates (Start/finish dates, up to four separate date ranges): 6/2/2025 – 5/17/2026
Total Hours Completed by June 1:  1010
Projected Additional Hours after June 1: 0

Experience Description (700 characters): 
I managed the full patient journey for 15–30 patients per shift. My role required balancing administrative pressure with hands-on clinical care. Up front, I handled intake and complex insurance verifications to slowdowns. In the back, I performed phlebotomy, captured vitals, ran point-of-care testing, and assisted with procedures like cyst and toenail removals. To maintain flow, I developed clinical foresight—preparing swabs or securing urine samples early to spare patients’ discomfort and give back some of provider-patient time. This role taught me to manage high-volume operations while ensuring every patient felt seen.

Most Meaningful Experience #1 Remarks (Additional 1325 characters):  
Working as the only assistant required me to develop clinical foresight and adaptability. I learned to anticipate the physician's needs, like securing samples early to minimize patient discomfort. 
I found purpose in the service aspect of care. There is a specific satisfaction in watching a patient limp in with an ingrown toenail and walk out pain-free, or hearing a child’s lungs clear up after a nebulizer. I realized I thrive on that tangible impact. But I also learned that medicine isn't always about a quick fix. Comforting patients receiving life-altering diagnoses like HSV2 or HIV taught me that technical skill isn't enough. In those moments, I couldn't just "fix" it; I had to slow down, fully hear them, and internalize their fear to offer real support.
Finally, I saw where the system fails. The hardest administrative moments involved telling sick patients we didn't take their insurance. I refused to let "policy" be the end of the conversation. I researched safety-net clinics and guided them to places that would treat them. This taught me that being a good doctor requires the hands-on skill to treat the body, the empathy to sit with difficult news, and the willingness to navigate the systems that hold patients back.

 
2.	Experience Type: Research/Lab
Experience Name: AI Ethics and Health Informatics Researcher
Contact Name, Title: Don Park MD; Orthopedic Surgeon

Dates (Start/finish dates, up to four separate date ranges): 6/19/2024 – 4/11/2025, 8/7/2025 - Present
Total Hours Completed by June 1: 110, 90 
Projected Additional Hours after June 1: at least 50

Experience Description (700 characters): 
AI is becoming integral to medicine, and rather than resist it, I sought to fill gaps for its safe, ethical use. At UCI Health, I led a study evaluating whether patients could safely rely on AI for advice in endoscopic spine surgery, coordinating ten surgeons and finding LLMs useful but unable to replace physician expertise (manuscript under review, Bulletin of the Hospital for Joint Diseases). At MGB’s MESH Incubator, led by Dr. Marc Succi, I studied clinician attitudes toward AI (pre-print in JMIR; DOI: 10.2196/preprints.87818) and now lead a manuscript on whether AI can ethically triage patients using ethical frameworks, like deontology or egalitarianism.

Most Meaningful Experience #2 Remarks (Additional 1325 characters):  
This experience transformed my career trajectory. My research at UCI reinforced the urgent need for oversight in medical AI, inspiring my Master’s focus and leading to my role at the MESH Incubator.
I faced skepticism from peers who view AI with suspicion, but running from it is pointless as the future of medicine is inseparable from AI. I chose to dive in headfirst, working to ensure these tools are used safely—to streamline billing, enhance image analysis, improve patient support, and reduce physician burnout—rather than being implemented recklessly.
Beyond the science, this work taught me the realities of leadership. Coordinating ethicists, surgeons, and researchers was rewarding but challenging. Research slows when many voices are involved, and leading a project requires more than scientific knowledge; it requires diplomacy and vision. Despite challenges, this experience lit a fire in me to continue working in this area to ensure that innovation serves patients and medical teams, rather than the other way around.

 
3.	Experience Type: Research/Lab
Experience Name: Neuro-Oncology Research Assistant 
Contact Name, Title: Matthew Waitkus, PhD; Assistant Professor in Neurosurgery 
Contact Email: matthew.waitkus@duke.edu
Organization Name: Waitkus Lab, Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center, Duke Health Neurosurgery
City, State, Country: Durham, NC, USA
Contact Phone:
Dates (Start/finish dates, up to four separate date ranges): 9/10/2022 – 5/9/2023, 8/28/2023 – 5/1/2025
Total Hours Completed by June 1: 1885
Projected Additional Hours after June 1: 0

Experience Description (700 characters): 
I joined the Waitkus Lab as a freshman to investigate treatments for glioma, a deadly brain tumor. My purpose was to determine if combining specific gene knockouts with drug inhibitors could stop tumor growth. My role evolved from assisting with general data collection to leading two independent studies and a senior thesis. I also conducted full-time research as a Duke Summer Neuroscience Program fellow. Working closely with my PI and post-docs, I contributed to hypothesis generation, experimental design, and data interpretation. This collaboration resulted in my Graduation with Distinction, a co-authored publication in Neuro-Oncology, and presentations at six conferences.
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noaf300

Most Meaningful Experience #3 Remarks (Additional 1325 characters): 
I committed to this lab for three years, working over 10 hours a week during semesters and 40 hours a week during one of my summers. This experience taught me that research is painfully slow and requires constant failure. For the first six months, I saw almost no success. I spent three full months trying to fix a Western blot protocol for a weak antibody that always looked "dirty." I also failed at confocal microscopy for weeks, producing unusable images despite hours in the darkroom.
I learned that the most important skill is simply showing up when things go wrong. I kept refining my techniques and asking for feedback. Eventually, I mastered the protocols. That specific Western blot finally produced clean data, and imaging became second nature. This persistence allowed me to progress from basic tasks to completing two independent studies and later a full senior thesis.
Working with people who had different working styles and personalities forced me to communicate clearly to keep my project moving. The real takeaway was developing the grit to keep working when things aren't working. I learned to accept that answers aren't always immediate and that progress requires patience, collaboration, and the willingness to show up every day even when the results aren't there yet.

Experience Description (700 characters): 
Noticing that many students lacked pre-health guidance until sophomore year and were excluded by selective, high-fee organizations, I founded a student network focused on free, early access to resources. Working with a 32-person team across Duke, UPenn, Brown, and JHU, we coordinated multi-campus mentorship programs, pairing undergraduates with residents and physicians, and speaker events with leaders such as Atul Gawande. We also organized first student-led national research conference at Duke with an attendance of over 160 undergraduates. Through this work, I learned how to identify gaps in support, coordinate large teams, and turn community needs into practical, inclusive solutions.

Projected Additional Hours after June 1: 0

Experience Description (700 characters): 
I served students from under-resourced schools in the Durham Public School System by delivering accessible, hands-on STEM education after school. Working in small groups, I adapted lessons in chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering to meet students’ varied learning styles and resource limitations. I also mentored three high school students conducting research on traumatic brain injuries, helping connect them with leaders in the field, refine questions, and communicate findings clearly. This experience highlighted how gaps in educational access shape long-term opportunities and taught me the importance of meeting learners where they are to support growth, confidence, and future success.

Experience Description (700 characters): 
Working the 3AM–8AM weekend shift taught me to balance clinical precision with empathy under pressure. Waking medically complex patients on cardiac and transplant units for time-sensitive tests, I frequently encountered delirium, fear, and resistance. I learned to respond with patience and clear communication while preserving each patient’s dignity during uncomfortable procedures. This role required adaptability and reliability to ensure essential labs were completed accurately for morning rounds. Caring for vulnerable patients in high-stress settings strengthened my ability to remain composed, compassionate, and accountable, even when fatigue and urgency threatened the quality of care.

Projected Additional Hours after June 1: 0

Experience Description (700 characters): 
This experience thought me that effective care goes beyond medical treatment. With residents facing memory loss, I used painting and reading to build trust, learning to connect with individuals even when verbal communication was limited. In the surgical department, I focused on reducing family anxiety by helping with admission logistics and offering a comforting presence during procedures. These environments allowed me to see the hospital through the patient's eyes—recognizing the fear or confusion that they don’t always reveal to doctors. I developed the patience to identify these hidden emotional states and the adaptability to address them through conversations or stress-relieving activities.

Total Hours Completed by June 1: 285
Projected Additional Hours after June 1: 0 (not sure)

Experience Description (700 characters): 
I shadowed physicians across eight specialties, from primary care to specialized surgery, observing how many of them skillfully deliver difficult news while preserving hope and understanding. In conversations with a neurosurgeon, I reflected on the necessity of seeing patients as people, not just cases, and the role of patient autonomy and trust in care. Working with a geneticist, I witnessed some Down syndrome patients travel 3+ hours and spend a full day with a coordinated team of 11 specialists, all working in tandem to ensure the best quality care. Together, these experiences revealed how medicine involves both philosophical sensitivity and harsh realities like inequities in access.

Experience Description (700 characters): 
I led a systematic review and case series on spontaneous and traumatic intra-orbital arteriovenous fistulas, a rare condition with only ~29 reported cases worldwide. I, in collaboration with Dr. Hauck, managed the project from conception to write-up, synthesizing data to inform treatment where no standard protocols existed. Conducting research while observing procedures in the cath lab helped me connect findings to the patients these interventions affected. This first-author publication in Journal of Neurosurgery: Case Lessons taught me how careful, evidence-driven research guides decision-making when clinical experience is limited and evidence is scarce.

Projected Additional Hours after June 1: ~50+

Experience Description (700 characters): 
For my MS in Bioethics capstone, I identified a gap in patient advocacy: while AI is increasingly used in care, patients rarely give informed consent. To address this, I designed the first Patient Decision Aid (PDA) specifically to help patients decide on AI involvement in their treatment. Adhering to IPADAS guidelines, I coded an interactive, accessible tool tailored for diverse literacy levels and cognitive abilities. I am currently drafting a manuscript and a press release to launch this tool for public use. This project taught me the complexity of translating high-level policy into practical, patient-facing education that truly empowers vulnerable populations to make informed choices.
